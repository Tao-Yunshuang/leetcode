Singly Linked List:

Each node in a singly-linked list contains not only the value but also a reference field to link to the next node. By this way, the singly-linked list organizes all the nodes in a sequence.

In most cases, we will use the head node (the first node) to represent the whole list.

Add Operation - Singly Linked List

If we want to add a new value after a given node prev, we should:
1. Initialize a new node cur with the given value;
2. Link the "next" field of cur to prev's next node next;
3. Link the "next" field in prev to cur.

Unlike an array, we donâ€™t need to move all elements past the inserted element. Therefore, you can insert a new node into a linked list in O(1) time complexity, which is very efficient.

Add a Node at the Beginning

As we know, we use the head node head to represent the whole list.

So it is essential to update head when adding a new node at the beginning of the list.
1. Initialize a new node cur;
2. Link the new node to our original head node head.
3. Assign cur to head.

Delete Operation - Singly Linked List
If we want to delete an existing node cur from the singly linked list, we can do it in two steps:
1. Find cur's previous node prev and its next node next;
2. Link prev to cur's next node next.

In our first step, we need to find out prev and next. It is easy to find out next using the reference field of cur. However, we have to traverse the linked list from the head node to find out prev which will take O(N) time on average, where N is the length of the linked list. So the time complexity of deleting a node will be O(N).

The space complexity is O(1) because we only need constant space to store our pointers.

Delete the First Node

If we want to delete the first node, the strategy will be a little different.

As we mentioned before, we use the head node head to represent a linked list.

If we want to delete the first node, we can simply assign the next node to head.
