Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Algorithm:
1. If x < 2, return x.
2. Set the left boundary to 2, and the right boundary to x / 2.
3. While left <= right:
4. Take num = (left + right) / 2 as a guess. Compute num * num and compare it with x:
5. If num * num > x, move the right boundary right = pivot -1
6. Else, if num * num < x, move the left boundary left = pivot + 1
7. Otherwise num * num == x, the integer square root is here, let's return it
8. Return right

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed).

Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Algorithm:
1. Initiate the pointer start to 0, and the pointer end to n - 1.
2. Perform standard binary search. While start <= end:
3. Take an index in the middle mid as a pivot.
4. If nums[mid] == target, the job is done, return mid.
5. Now there could be two situations:
6. Pivot element is larger than the first element in the array, i.e. the subarray from the first element to the pivot is non-rotated, as shown in the following graph.
7. If the target is located in the non-rotated subarray: go left: `end = mid - 1`.
8. Otherwise: go right: `start = mid + 1`.
9. Pivot element is smaller than the first element of the array, i.e. the rotation index is somewhere between 0 and mid. It implies that the sub-array from the pivot element to the last one is non-rotated, as shown in the following graph.
10. If the target is located in the non-rotated subarray: go right: `start = mid + 1`.
11. Otherwise: go left: `end = mid - 1`.
12. We're here because the target is not found. Return -1.

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Algorithm:
1. We start off by finding the middle element, mid from the given nums array.
2. If this element happens to be lying in a descending sequence of numbers. or a local falling slope(found by comparing nums[i] to its right neighbour), it means that the peak will always lie towards the left of this element.
3. Thus, we reduce the search space to the left of mid(including itself) and perform the same process on left subarray.
4. If the middle element, mid lies in an ascending sequence of numbers, or a rising slope(found by comparing nums[i] to its right neighbour), it obviously implies that the peak lies towards the right of this element.
5. Thus, we reduce the search space to the right of mid and perform the same process on the right subarray.
