An Array is a collection of items. The items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory locations.
On a computer, Arrays can hold up to N items. The value of N is decided by you, the programmer, at the time you create the Array.
Each of the places is identified using a number in the range of 0 to N - 1. We call these numbers that identify each place indexes.
