An Array is a collection of items. The items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory locations.
On a computer, Arrays can hold up to N items. The value of N is decided by you, the programmer, at the time you create the Array.
Each of the places is identified using a number in the range of 0 to N - 1. We call these numbers that identify each place indexes.

Array Insertions:
Inserting at the End of an Array:
At any point in time, we know the index of the last element of the Array, as we've kept track of it in our length variable. All we need to do for inserting an element at the end is to assign the new element to one index past the current last element.
Inserting at the Start of an Array:
To insert an element at the start of an Array, we'll need to shift all other elements in the Array to the right by one index to create space for the new element. This is a very costly operation, since each of the existing elements has to be shifted one step to the right. The need to shift everything implies that this is not a constant time operation. In fact, the time taken for insertion at the beginning of an Array will be proportional to the length of the Array. In terms of time complexity analysis, this is a linear time complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the Array.
Inserting Anywhere in the Array:
Similarly, for inserting at any given index, we first need to shift all the elements from that index onwards one position to the right. Once the space is created for the new element, we proceed with the insertion. If you think about it, insertion at the beginning is basically a special case of inserting an element at a given indexâ€”in that case, the given index was 0.
