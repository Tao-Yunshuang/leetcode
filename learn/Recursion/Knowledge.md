Recursion is an approach to solving problems using a function that calls itself as a subroutine.

You might wonder how we can implement a function that calls itself. The trick is that each time a recursive function calls itself, it reduces the given problem into subproblems. The recursion call continues until it reaches a point where the subproblem can be solved without further recursion.

A recursive function should have the following properties so that it does not result in an infinite loop:
1. A simple base case (or cases) â€” a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer.
2. A set of rules, also known as recurrence relation that reduces all other cases towards the base case.
Note that there could be multiple places where the function may call itself.
